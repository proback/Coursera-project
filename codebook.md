Our final (tidy) data set contains means of all 66 features containing mean() or std() by subject and activity, for a 
total of 180 rows and 68 columns.  The final data set is written as a .txt file called "course3project.txt".  Specific 
variables are described below:

1) subject	- subject ID (1-30) <br>
2) activity - one of 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

The remaining 66 columns reflect means across a specific subject and activity.  Note that the measurements are standardized 
on a -1 to 1 scale and thus unitless.  Here is a guide to these variable names:
 - "time" refers to the time domain of the signal
 - "frequency" refers to the frequency domain of the signal from a FFT
 - "Body" refers to the Body component of the accelerometer readings
 - "Gravity" refers to the Gravity component of the accelerometer readings
 - "Mean" refers to original data that was a calculated signal average in a window sample
 - "SD" refers to original data that was a calculated standard deviation of signals in a window sample
 - "axis" refers to the direction of the signal (X, Y, or Z direction)
 - "Jerk" refers to a measure derived from body linear acceleration and angular velocity
 - "Magnitude" refers to signal magnitude based on Euclidean norm

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person 
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration 
and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data 
manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for 
generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-
width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has 
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and 
gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff 
frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency 
domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Notes: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

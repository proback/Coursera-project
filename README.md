# Coursera-project
Project files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project

course3 final.R is a commented R script which starts with "raw" data downloaded from the UCI HAR Dataset and creates a tidy data set as specified in the project instructions for Course 3 on Getting and Cleaning Data

course3 project codebook.txt describes the data wrangling process and what variables are ultimately contained in the final tidy data set

course3project.csv is the final tidy data set.  It can be read into R using: read.csv(".\\data\\course3project.csv") assuming you stored it in the data folder of your working directory
